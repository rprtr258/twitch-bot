6. Adding to Pyth

Pyth is an enthusiastically open source project. If you've caught a bug, thought up a cool new idea, or want to add to the project in any way, you can do so via `Pyth's Github page <https://github.com/isaacg1/pyth>`_. If you want to leave a suggestion, file a bug a report or simply get help with the language, you can open an issue by clicking on "New issue" `here <https://github.com/isaacg1/pyth/issues>`_. If you've got some code you'd like add, you can do so via a pull request. For information on how to do so, `look here <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/>`_.

However you end up using Pyth, I hope you enjoy it.
